    "We hypothesize that higher True Shooting Percentage (TS%, defined as a player’s scoring efficiency accounting for field goals, three-pointers, and free throws) and BPM (Box Plus Minus) values are positively associated with NBA draft selection. Specifically, we expect that players with higher efficiency and overall impact metrics will have a greater probability of being drafted (Drafted = 1).\n",
    "\n",
    "We believe TS% and BPM are particularly important because they capture overall scoring efficiency and a player’s total on-court impact, rather than raw scoring volume alone. Unlike traditional statistics that reflect usage or opportunity, efficiency-based metrics better account for shot quality, decision-making, and two-way contribution, which may be more indicative of NBA-ready performance. Additionally, we expect player characteristics such as position, and participation in higher-profile conferences to be positively associated with draft selection."

    "- Dataset Name: College Basketball Players 2009 – 2021\n",
    "- Link to the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adityak2003/college-basketball-players-20092021\n",
    "- Number of observations: The dataset contains 61,061 player-season observations from NCAA Division I men’s basketball between 2009 and 2021. Each row represents one player in one season.\n",
    "- Number of variables: 65\n",
    "- Variables most relevant to this project:\n",
    "  - True Shooting Percentage (TS%): A scoring efficiency metric that accounts for field goals, three-point shots, and free throws. It is expressed as a proportion (typically between 0 and 1). Higher values indicate more efficient scoring performance.\n",
    "  - Box Plus-Minus (BPM): An advanced metric estimating a player's overall contribution per 100 possessions relative to an average player. A value of 0 represents average impact, positive values indicate above-average performance, and negative values indicate below-average impact.\n",
    "  - College Conference Affiliation: A categorical variable identifying the NCAA conference in which the player competed (e.g., ACC, SEC, Big Ten). Conference strength may influence visibility, level of competition, and draft exposure.\n",
    "  - College Year (Class Year): A categorical variable indicating the player’s academic/eligibility year (Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, Senior). Underclassmen may have different draft probabilities due to perceived long-term potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Description of shortcomings this dataset has with respect to the project:\n",
    "  - The dataset is observational and does not include qualitative scouting information such as injury history, leadership ability, or work ethic, which may influence draft decisions.\n",
    "  - Players appear multiple times across seasons, requiring us to restrict the analysis to each player’s final collegiate season to ensure independence.\n",
    "  - Advanced metrics such as BPM or TS% may have missing values in some seasons, particularly in earlier years.\n",

    "### NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Player Dataset (2009-2021) #1 \n",
    "\n",
    "#### Detailed Description of Dataset #1: College Basketball Players 2009–2021\n",
    "\n",
    "The College Basketball Players 2009–2021 dataset contains season-level statistics for NCAA Division I men’s basketball players across multiple seasons. Each row represents one player in one season, and the dataset includes both traditional box-score statistics and advanced efficiency metrics. Because it includes all Division I players rather than only drafted athletes, it provides a comprehensive population from which draft outcomes can later be examined.\n",
    "\n",
    "The most important variables for this project are True Shooting Percentage (TS%), Box Plus-Minus (BPM), college conference affiliation, and college year (class year).\n",
    "\n",
    "- True Shooting Percentage (TS%) is an advanced scoring efficiency metric expressed as a proportion between 0 and 1 (sometimes displayed as a percentage). It accounts for two-point field goals, three-point field goals, and free throws, providing a more complete measure of scoring efficiency than field goal percentage alone. In NCAA basketball, average TS% values typically fall around 0.50–0.55. Values above 0.60 indicate highly efficient scoring, while values below 0.45 suggest poor efficiency. Because TS% adjusts for shot value and free-throw attempts, it better reflects shot selection and scoring effectiveness.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Box Plus-Minus (BPM) is an advanced metric measured in estimated points per 100 possessions relative to an average NCAA player. A BPM of 0 represents average impact. Positive values indicate above-average overall contribution, while negative values indicate below-average impact. For example, a BPM of +5 suggests a strong impact player who significantly improves team performance, while a BPM of −3 indicates below-average contribution. BPM attempts to summarize a player’s total offensive and defensive impact using box-score statistics, making it useful for evaluating overall effectiveness rather than scoring volume alone.\n",
    "\n",
    "- College Conference Affiliation is a categorical variable identifying the NCAA conference in which the player competed (e.g., ACC, SEC, Big Ten). Conference membership is not measured in numeric units but represents structural context. Players in higher-profile conferences may face stronger competition and receive greater national exposure, potentially influencing draft outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "- College Year (Class Year) is a categorical variable (Freshman, Sophomore, Junior, Senior) representing a player’s eligibility level. This variable captures experience and development stage. Underclassmen (especially freshmen) may be drafted based on projected potential, while seniors may be evaluated differently due to age and perceived development ceiling.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Major Concerns and Limitations of the Dataset\n",
    "\n",
    "Although this dataset is large and comprehensive, several concerns are relevant to this project:\n",
    "\n",
    "First, the dataset is observational and purely quantitative. It does not include qualitative scouting evaluations such as leadership, defensive communication, athletic testing results, injury history, or personality assessments. NBA draft decisions rely heavily on these qualitative factors, meaning statistical performance alone may not fully explain draft outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "Second, the dataset includes repeated observations for players across multiple seasons. Without proper filtering, this could violate independence assumptions. To address this, we will restrict the analysis to each player’s final collegiate season prior to draft eligibility.\n",
    "\n",
    "Third, advanced metrics such as TS% and BPM may have missing values in certain seasons, particularly in earlier years where advanced tracking was less consistent. Missing data may not be random; for example, players with limited minutes may lack sufficient possessions for advanced metrics to be computed reliably.\n",
    "\n",
    "Fourth, college performance statistics are influenced by team system, pace of play, coaching strategy, and conference strength. As a result, efficiency metrics may partially reflect contextual factors rather than pure individual ability.\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, because the dataset includes all Division I players, there may be substantial variability in playing time. Players with very limited minutes may exhibit extreme TS% or BPM values due to small sample sizes, which could create statistical outliers that require careful handling. Using the IQR method we decided on setting upper and lower fences for TS% and BPM in order to filter out any outliers. \n",

    "Ethics Checklist:\n",
    "\n",
    "A. Data Collection\n",
    "\n",
    "☐ A.1 Informed consent\n",
    "\n",
    " This project does not involve direct interaction with human subjects or the collection of original data. All data used consists of publicly available college basketball statistics and NBA draft records, which were collected by third-party organizations for public use. As a result, informed consent from individual subjects is not applicable in this context.\n",
    "\n",
    "☒ A.2 Collection bias\n",
    "\n",
    " The data used in this project may reflect bias introduced during data collection because college basketball statistics and NBA draft outcomes are shaped by unequal media exposure, conference visibility, and scouting attention. Players from major conferences or high-profile programs may receive more attention than equally skilled players from smaller schools. This project acknowledges that draft outcomes are not a purely objective measure of ability and may reflect these existing biases.\n",
    "\n",
    "☒ A.3 Limit PII exposure\n",
    "\n",
    " This project uses only publicly available data and does not include sensitive or private personal information. Player attributes such as height, age, and position are already public and directly relevant to the analysis. No unnecessary personally identifiable information is collected or displayed.\n",
    "\n",
    "☒ A.4 Downstream bias mitigation\n",
    "\n",
    " Although the project does not use protected group labels, it recognizes that draft outcomes may reflect border systemic inequities. The analysis avoids treating draft selection as a measure of intrinsic player value and explicitly frames findings as exploratory associations rather than normative judgements.\n",
    "\n",
    "B. Data Storage\n",
    "\n",
    "☒ B.1 Data security\n",
    "\n",
    " All datasets will be stored locally or in private course repositories and used only for this class project. Since the data is public and non-sensitive, security risks are minimal, but basic precautions such as restricted access and avoiding unnecessary data sharing will still be followed.\n",
    "\n",
    "☒ B.2 Right to be forgotten\n",
    "\n",
    "There is no mechanism for individual data removal. All data originate from publicly archived sources that are outside the control of the research team. \n",
    "\n",
    "☒ B.3 Data retention plan\n",
    "\n",
    "The datasets will be retained only for the duration of the academic project. No long-term reuse or redistribution of the compiled dataset is planned beyond course requirements. \n",
    "\n",
    "C. Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "☒ C.1 Missing perspectives\n",
    "\n",
    " This analysis focuses on quantitative performance metrics and does not capture qualitative factors such as leadership, work ethic, injury history, or scouting evaluations. These missing perspectives are acknowledged, and results will be interpreted with the understanding that statistics alone do not fully explain NBA draft decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "☒ C.2 Dataset bias\n",
    "\n",
    " NBA draft outcomes may embed historical and structural biases related to visibility, playing style preferences, or organizational decision-making. The analysis will avoid treating draft position as an objective ground truth and will frame results as associations rather than definitive evaluations of player quality.\n",
    "\n",
    "☒ C.3 Honest representation\n",
    "\n",
    " Visualizations and summary statistics will be designed to accurately reflect the data without exaggerating trends or implying causation. Any limitations or weak relationships observed will be clearly reported rather than omitted.\n",
    "\n",
    "☒ C.4 Privacy in analysis\n",
    "\n",
    " No private or sensitive personal information is used or displayed in the analysis beyond what is necessary to answer the research question.\n",
    "\n",
    "☒ C.5 Auditability\n",
    "\n",
    " The analysis will be documented in a Jupyter notebook with clear explanations of data sources, cleaning steps, and analysis decisions so that results can be reproduced or reviewed if questions arise later.\n",
    "\n",
    "D. Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "☒ D.1 Proxy discrimination\n",
    "\n",
    " This project does not intentionally include variables that serve as proxies for protected characteristics. However, it acknowledges that some variables, such as conference or school, could indirectly reflect broader inequalities, and results will be interpreted cautiously.\n",
    "\n",
    "☐ D.2 Fairness across groups\n",
    "\n",
    " Formal fairness testing is not conducted because the project does not involve high-stakes decision-making or protected group labels. This limitation is explicitly acknowledged.\n",
    "\n",
    "☒ D.3 Metric selection\n",
    "\n",
    " Any models or regressions used are intended for exploratory analysis rather than optimization or decision-making. Metrics are chosen to understand relationships, not to rank or judge individual players.\n",
    "\n",
    "☒ D.4 Explainability\n",
    "\n",
    " All modeling approaches used in this project will be simple and interpretable, making it clear how variables relate to draft outcomes.\n",
    "\n",
    "☒ D.5 Communicate limitations\n",
    "\n",
    " The limitations and assumptions of the analysis will be clearly stated so results are not misunderstood or overgeneralized.\n",
    "\n",
    "E. Deployment\n",
    "\n",
    "☐ E.1 Monitoring and evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    " This project does not deploy a model or system in a real-world setting, so ongoing monitoring is not applicable.\n",
    "\n",
    "☐ E.2 Redress\n",
    "\n",
    " Because the analysis is not used to make real decisions about individuals, there is no formal redress mechanism.\n",
    "\n",
    "☐ E.3 Roll back\n",
    "\n",
    " The project does not involve deployment, so rollback procedures are not relevant.\n",
    "\n",
    "☒ E.4 Unintended use\n",
    "\n",
    " There is a risk that readers could overinterpret the results as definitive evaluations of player potential. To reduce this risk, the project explicitly frames findings as exploratory and contextual rather than prescriptive.\n"

We expect responses within 24 hours during the week unless someone communicates otherwise. The team will meet at least once per week, either in person or virtually, to check in on progress, discuss difficulties, and plan next steps.\n",

Tasks and deadlines will be clearly assigned and tracked in a shared document so everyone can see progress. If someone is struggling to complete a task, they are expected to communicate this early so the team can adjust or provide support.\n",
    "\n",
    "Team Expectation 4: Decision-Making Process\n",
    "\n",
    " Most decisions will be made through group discussion and consensus when possible. If a decision needs to be made quickly and not all members are available, the members present will move forward and update the rest of the team afterward. For technical or section-specific decisions, responsibility may be delegated to the member leading that part of the project.\n",
    "\n",
    "Team Expectation 5: Handling Conflict and Team Issues\n",
    "\n",
    " If conflicts or concerns arise, we will address them directly and respectfully as a group rather than letting issues build up. If a team member consistently does not meet agreed upon expectations, the group will first communicate concerns clearly and give the member an opportunity to improve. If issues continue, we will follow the course policy and reach out to the instructor as needed.\n"
