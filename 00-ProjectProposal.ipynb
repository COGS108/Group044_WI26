    "The NBA Draft is one of the most important mechanisms through which teams acquire young talent, yet predicting which college basketball players will succeed at the professional level remains extremely difficult. Despite teams having access to extensive scouting resources and increasingly detailed performance data, draft outcomes often fail to align with future NBA productivity. This uncertainty has motivated researchers to examine whether measurable college basketball statistics can meaningfully explain draft position and downstream success, and whether decision makers systematically rely on the “right” information when making draft selections.\n",
    "\n",
    "Prior research by Sailofsky (2018) examined NCAA Division I basketball statistics and pre-draft player characteristics to determine which factors predict NBA draft position and future NBA performance.<sup><a href=\"#ref1\">1</a></sup> Using regression models on players drafted between 2006 and 2013, the study found that NBA teams tend to emphasize variables such as scoring totals, size, and college conference affiliation, even though these factors do not strongly predict NBA success. Instead, the paper highlights offensive efficiency, ball control, and rebounding efficiency as more reliable indicators of professional performance. This work suggests that draft decisions are often influenced by cognitive biases and overconfidence, leading teams to prioritize visible or traditional metrics rather than those most closely tied to winning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, Liner (2020) explored the disconnect between draft position and on-court productivity by analyzing historical draft data and player performance metrics.<sup><a href=\"#ref2\">2</a></sup> Their work reinforces the idea that draft order is an imperfect proxy for player value and that teams frequently overestimate their ability to evaluate talent. The study emphasizes that while statistical modeling can identify patterns in draft outcomes, uncertainty and volatility remain central features of the draft process. These findings motivate further analysis into which college-level indicators are consistently associated with draft outcomes, rather than assuming that high draft picks necessarily reflect superior performance potential.\n",
    "\n",
    "Beyond performance uncertainty, another reason we are interested in analyzing draft position is the financial structure of the NBA draft. Rookie contracts are tightly regulated by the league’s salary scale, meaning that players selected earlier in the draft are guaranteed significantly higher earnings regardless of performance. As outlined by Sports Illustrated, top draft picks receive multimillion-dollar contracts that can shape both team payrolls and player careers for years.<sup><a href=\"#ref3\">3</a></sup> This financial context underscores why understanding the relationship between college performance metrics and draft position is important, as draft evaluations directly impact both competitive balance and economic outcomes for players and teams.\n",
    "\n",
    "Building on this prior work, our project focuses specifically on examining the statistical relationships between college basketball performance metrics and NBA draft outcomes for players eligible for the NBA Draft. Our analysis aims to identify patterns and associations in the data, contributing to existing research on draft decision-making and highlighting which types of college-level statistics appear most closely linked to draft selection and draft position.\n",

   "metadata": {},
   "source": [
    "We expect that college basketball players with stronger advanced efficiency metrics, such as true shooting percentage, PER, and BPM, will be more likely to be drafted and picked earlier in the NBA Draft. These metrics capture how efficiently and consistently a player contributes on the court, which likely matters more to NBA teams than raw box-score numbers alone, especially when projecting how a player’s skills will translate to the professional level.\n"

    "The ideal dataset for this project would include college basketball players who are eligible for the NBA Draft, along with both their college performance statistics and draft outcomes. The main variables would include traditional box-score stats such as points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocks, as well as advanced efficiency metrics like true shooting percentage, PER, and BPM. Player attributes such as height, weight, age, position, conference, and team performance would also be included to provide additional context. To have enough data for meaningful analysis, the dataset would ideally include several hundred player observations across multiple college seasons. These data would be collected from publicly available college basketball statistics websites and combined with official NBA draft records. The data would be organized in a tabular format, with each row representing a player and columns representing their statistics and draft outcomes.\n",

    "1. https://www.kaggle.com/code/charlsslrahc/nbadraft (Draft)\n",
    "\n",
    "This source provides a structured dataset containing player attributes, college performance statistics, and NBA career outcome measures, making it highly relevant for analyzing relationships between college performance and draft success. The inclusion of variables such as points, rebounds, shooting percentages, draft position, and career win shares supports both descriptive and predictive analysis aligned with the research question. The dataset is especially useful because it links college metrics directly to professional performance indicators, allowing for evaluation of which statistics best predict draft outcomes. To further strengthen its use, it would be helpful to confirm the dataset’s size, time coverage, and whether it includes advanced efficiency metrics such as PER or BPM needed to fully test the project hypothesis.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. https://www.kaggle.com/code/yyue11/college-basketball-data-analysis (College) \n",
    "\n",
    "This source is useful background because it clearly defines a set of advanced team-level efficiency metrics (e.g., ADJOE, ADJDE, EFG%, TOR) and demonstrates how they can be analyzed to identify performance differences across outcomes. The key takeaway that ADJOE is strongly associated with “championship-caliber” teams supports your hypothesis that efficiency-based metrics can be more informative than raw box-score totals. It also provides a concrete analysis template (correlations, boxplots, and significance testing across groups) that your team could adapt when comparing drafted vs. non-drafted players or earlier vs. later draft picks. To align it more directly with your research question, you’d want to translate these team-level metrics into player-level efficiency measures (or justify using team context) and clarify how these features will be incorporated into your draft prediction models.\n",
